/**
 * Challenge: Wire up the partially-finished travel form so that it works!
 * Remember to use the concept of controlled forms
 * https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html
 * 
 * All information should be populating the text below the form in real-time
 * as you're filling it out
 * 
 * This exercise is adapted from the V School curriculum on vanilla JS forms:
 * https://coursework.vschool.io/travel-form/
 * 
 * All of our challenges and learning resources are open for the public
 * to play around with and learn from at https://coursework.vschool.io
